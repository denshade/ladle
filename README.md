thelaboflieven.info.Ladle is a build system that brings modern capabilities, but rejects framework complication.

What makes frameworks handy is that they bring default functionality.
So you don't need to know the details. 

Problems are: 
1. Hard to debug, I added this field, why is it not working or triggered?
2. Hard to optimize. Where do you even start?
3. High learning curve if you need to change some out of the ordinary.
4. Low backwards compatibility: New versions require elaborate reconfiguring. 
5. Custom workflows are done in languages you don't know/have limited experience with. 
6. Hard to customize small things. How do I add a specific flag to the JVM?

thelaboflieven.info.Ladle supports: 
1. Downloading dependencies
2. Building class files
3. Building jar files.
4. Running unit tests

thelaboflieven.info.Ladle will optimize for transparency and speed.
It will document clearly each and every used parameter.
